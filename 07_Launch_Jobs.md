# Launching Jobs

## Learning Objectives
- understand the difference between login and comput nodes
- understand the two ways to launch jobs on TACC - launcher.slurm and launcher creator.py
- use both ways to launch jobs

## Analogy for login versus compute nodes
Recall the lat time you went to the dentist or the doctor. When you arrived, you signed in, filled out a bunch of paper work about you and your insurance, and maybe paid a co-pay. Then you waited around and read a magazine or played on your phone until your name was called. Then you went into the procedure room where the doctor and nurses came and worked their magic. 

Its not a perfect analogy, but I think this helps conceptualize login and compute nodes. The login nodes are where you go to get all your paper work in order and settle the payment, but compute nodes are where the magic of bioinformatics or computing happen. In the same way that a doctor won't opporate on you in the waiting room, don't do your hard core computing on the login nodes.

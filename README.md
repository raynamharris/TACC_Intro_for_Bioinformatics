# Intro to TACC for Bioinformatics

By Rayna Harris 
June 21, 2016

## Rationale

It is almost impossible to analyze and visualize next-generation sequencing data on a personal computer, so we must learn to use a high-performance computing system. We will use the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) for most of our data processing and analysis. The following lessons are designed to familiarize you with the TACC for binformatics.

## The Lessons
1. [Overview of TACC](lessons/01_TACC_Overview.md)
2. [Creating a TACC account](lessons/02_Create_Account.md)
3. [Using TACC](lessons/03_Using_TACC.md)
4. [Configuring your profile](lessons/04_Configure_Profile.md)
5. [The Motivating Datasets](lessons/05_Datasets.md)
6. [Modules](lessons/06_Modules.md)
7. [How to Launch Batch Jobs](lessons/07_Launch_Jobs.md)
8. [My First Batch Job](lessons/08_First_Batch_Job.md)

## Handout of Commands
You will you a handful of bash commands over an over again. For your reference, we created [this handout of commonly used commands](handout.md).

# TACC Overview

## Learning objectives
- understand what TACC is and what it is useful for
- know where to go get help
- obtain a TACC id 
- know how to get on a TACC allocation
- use the TACC User Portal to view allocations and job history
- know what the bioiteam is

## What is TACC
Texas Advanced Computing Center provides:
- High performance computing systems- large clusters, capable of running highly parallel computation and advanced visualization.
- Large data storage and data archival capabilities.
- Software packages already installed on the clusters.

Cluster systems are made up of multiple computers, connected together to act as one. Each computer is called a node in the cluster and can have multiple processors (called cores).  Users log in to the cluster through a limited number of head nodes and submit jobs to the many compute nodes.  These systems are inherently parallel and can be greatly beneficial when your jobs are also parallelized.

## Getting Help
Read the [user guides](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/user-services/user-guides) to find documentation on TACC systems
